# Zoom Alfred Workflow

## TL;DR
Directly join [**Zoom**](https://www.zoom.us) meetings scheduled in **Google Calendar** via [**Alfred App**](https://www.alfredapp.com) *WITHOUT* having to go through a browser redirect.

The workflow lists all meetings in the next 48 hours with a zoom link in a Google Calendar event. The Zoom link is detected in these 3 event fields:
* the location field,
* the main calendar event text, or
* the zoom conferencing entry, created via the Zoom addon for Google Calendar.

Zoom links with a name rather than a zoom room number are currently not supported.

## What do I need?
1. Zoom app
1. Alfred + Powerpack
1. Google Account

## Installation and Setup
Download and install the workflow (either [build from source](https://github.com/gseitz/zoom-alfred-workflow#how-to-build) or from the [releases page](https://github.com/gseitz/zoom-alfred-workflow/releases) on github)

### Client Credentials

1. Copy the verification code
1. Invoke the workflow again and action the second entry `2. Enter Verification Code`: ![Enter Verification Code](images/enter_code.png)
